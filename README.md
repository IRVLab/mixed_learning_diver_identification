# Diver identification for Huamn-robot collaboration
# usage
-train your diver detection model by Faster R-CNN according to this [tutorial](https://gist.github.com/douglasrizzo/c70e186678f126f1b9005ca83d8bd2ce)
- under the tensorflow/models/research/object_detecion/detection_obj.py, set the path to your labels, test images and frozen training graphs
- under the path to your test images folder, the final training results will be shown (i.e., override the original images).
